I thought MavensMate was a plugin for Sublime Text?\r\n\r\nOK, it *WAS*. But now, we've rewritten MavensMate to be a cross-platform, text editor agnostic tool for developing Force.com applications. The [Sublime Text plugin][MMST2] still exists, it just utilizes the newly rewritten APIs in this project.\r\n\r\n### What is mm?\r\n\r\n`mm` is the executable that performs the heavy lifting. It can create new projects, compile code, move code between orgs, run apex tests, etc...and it's all JSON-based. Simply feed it JSON to provide context to your request, and it will respond in JSON. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n##### Request\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mm -o compile_project <<< '{ \"project_name\" : \"myproject\" }'\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Response\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"success\" : true,\r\n\t\"body\"\t  : \"Your operation completed successfully\"\t\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information on mm's capabilities, head over to the [README][mmreadme]\r\n\r\n### What is mmserver?\r\n\r\n`mmserver` is a local http server that the out-of-box MavensMate UI uses to interact with the `mm` tool. The OOB MavensMate UI is written in HTML/CSS/JS, so to maintain a solid user experience, it makes Ajax calls to a local web server which in turns makes all the terminal calls to `mm`. If you're writing a MavensMate plugin, your UI can use `mmserver` or you can simply call `mm` directly from your plugin's UI.\r\n\r\n### How can I write a plugin?\r\n\r\nPick your favorite text editor with extension capability and utilize the `mm` and `mmserver` tools to build fully-functional Force.com IDEs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[MMST2]: https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate-SublimeText\r\n[mmreadme]: https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate/tree/master/mm#mm","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
